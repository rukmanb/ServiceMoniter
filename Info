In this project contain five main java classes to fulfil requirements. Also this contain two test classes.
The class Caller.jave can use as client class which anyone can register a service and start.
That class contains an example how to register the service
User can register class using “registerService( Service service )” method and it will return relevant service id .
User can terminate the service by using the method “stopService( int id )”.
In this implementation when server status changes it will print that using system out . It can enhance to pass out put to end user.
Also this needs to update to use logging framework for log required information.
For test classes it’s not use Mocking which needs to use for test cases that link to methods that have dependency.
